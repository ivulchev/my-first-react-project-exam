# F1- FanHome project for my react exam

## My first repository and my forst project
It's my first time to make a project. It's about one of my favourite sports Formula 1. The app has some dynamic pages with drivers, teams, legends and memes. They are reachable by every user, but guests cannot make interaction with them. The App have login, register and logout services. Also likes and dislikes of every team, driver, legend or meme, for just one time. Can't be voted twice per one object. Owners of memes can't vote for them but can do edit and delete operation. The App also has details page for every driver,team or legend. Pages Calendar and Standings makes request to external API with live time information about points and races. I used React.js for this App. The app is deployed in Firebase. The link - https://f1-fanhome.web.app/.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## `back-end server`

You can start the back - end server with command prompt. In the directory open a command prompt and run node server.js.
