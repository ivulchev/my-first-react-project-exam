        <p>There will be 10 teams competing for the Constructors' Championship during the 2022 F1 season. The defending champions are Mercedes, which have signed George Russell as Lewis Hamilton's new teammate. Drivers' Champion Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez continue at Red Bull, as do Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz at Ferrari.

Mercedes claimed an eighth successive F1 Constructors' world title in 2021, getting the better of Red Bull at the end of a season-long battle on and off the track.

But will last year's main contenders stay on top for F1's new era? A whole host of changes have been made to the cars for 2022, with the likes of Ferrari and McLaren looking to join the lead battle. And could another team, such as Alpine, spring a surprise?

Below you can find information about all 10 teams, including driver line-ups, histories and statistics, while a selection of photos and videos highlight some of their best moments.</p>

        <p>A total of 20 drivers will take to the grid for the 2022 Formula 1 season. Max Verstappen is the reigning World Champion after beating Lewis Hamilton to the 2021 crown in dramatic circumstances. But who will come out on top in F1's new era?

Max Verstappen heads into F1's 2022 rules reset as the World Champion, having edged out Lewis Hamilton in a thrilling 2021 title battle that reached boiling point on and off the track, and was settled in controversial fashion at the final round in Abu Dhabi.

For 2022, the pecking order could look very different. Red Bull and Mercedes, which put so much effort and resource into last season, will be hoping that they have done enough to stay at the forefront, while the likes of Ferrari, McLaren and Alpine are all looking to make a jump forward.

There will be one new face on the grid in 2022, as Guanyu Zhou steps up from Formula 2 to a seat with Alfa Romeo, while Alex Albon returns to the field with Williams, having sat out the 2021 season after losing his Red Bull drive. Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi have both left the sport.
